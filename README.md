# 📊 Bank Loan Analysis – Power BI Project  

This project analyzes **Bank Loan Data** to monitor loan performance, track repayment behavior, and assess borrower risk.  
Using **SQL, Excel/Power Query, and Power BI**, the system delivers an interactive loan portfolio dashboard that provides financial institutions with **actionable insights** for smarter lending decisions.

## 🔎 Problem Statement  

Banks process thousands of loan applications every month. It is critical to:  

- Track **loan volume and funding distribution**  
- Monitor **repayment behavior** (Good vs Bad Loans)  
- Segment **risk by loan purpose, term, employment length, and home ownership**  
- Identify **regional trends and seasonal spikes**  

👉 The goal: **Identify profitable borrower segments, minimize risk exposure, and provide executives with real-time monitoring tools.**

## 🚀 Project Workflow  

1. **Data Extraction (SQL)**  
   - Used **MS SQL Server** for joins, CTEs, window functions & aggregations.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation (Excel + Power Query)**  
   - Removed inconsistencies, modeled relationships, and prepared data for BI.  

3. **Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**  
   - Built interactive dashboards with **DAX measures** and **Time Intelligence** (MTD/MoM).  
   - Implemented slicers & drill-throughs for deeper analysis.
