📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Bank Loan Data to monitor loan performance, track repayment patterns, and evaluate borrower risks. The data was extracted and aggregated using SQL, cleaned & modeled with Excel/Power Query, and visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The dashboard provides financial institutions with actionable insights into total applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and borrower characteristics, helping them make data-driven lending decisions.

🔎 Problem Statement

Banks process thousands of loan applications every month, making it essential to track:

The total loan volume and funding distribution

Borrower repayment patterns (good vs bad loans)

Risk segmentation by loan purpose, term, home ownership, employment length

Regional loan distribution and seasonal application spikes

The goal of this project was to identify profitable segments, minimize risk exposure, and provide executives with real-time monitoring tools.

Average DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio): 13.3%

Month-to-Date (MTD) & Month-over-Month (MoM) trends for all KPIs

2️⃣ Loan Quality Analysis

Good Loan % (86.2%) vs Bad Loan % (13.8%)

Applications, funded amount, and received amount split by loan quality

Loan status distribution for portfolio health

3️⃣ Loan Segmentation Insights
